      <h1 class="w3-xlarge w3-text-blue"><b>Why do we even have them?</b></h1>
      <p><span class="w3-xlarge"></span> Third-Party Cookies are cookies that are set by a website and keep track of your cookies 
      when you jump back and forth between websites. Which is much different than First party cookie. First party cookies are cookies 
      that are only tracked on the specific domain you are on; they help keep your shopping cart and remember certain things you select. 
      While first party cookies do exist, they are hardly ever used anymore. The best way to describe Third-Party Cookies is like “trail of crumbs” 
      as mentioned in the article by cookiescript.com. When you are a user browsing through a webpage every tab you have open creates a crumb on the trail 
      and when you move on to the next page the trail is still there. 
      
      <p><span class="w3-xlarge"></span>   So as you move on from each page you are relaying information into other websites 
      in order for them to push certain ads or marketing to you. They not only are able to do this through just remembering certain websites you have visited 
      you can also, use a website where you may have used your email to create a log in and the cookies were actually able to store your data so later you may 
      have gotten an email for a coupon for something you looked up hours before. Cookies are something that most users can disable by clearing the cookies and 
      cache so third parties are not able to track what you are visiting, but lots of people find them helpful as they are able to get ads from companies for 
      products and are able to find more of what they are looking for. </p>
